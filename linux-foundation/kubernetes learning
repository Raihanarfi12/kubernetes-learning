Objects in kubernetes:
  - cluster --> group of nodes for kubernetes infrastructure
  - node --> can be physic machine or virtual machine
    - control plane
      - api server
      - controller manager
      - scheduler
      - kubelet
      - kube-proxy
    - worker
      - kubelet
      - kube-proxy
  - pods --> smallest unit in kubernetes
  - namespace --> sub-cluster
  - labels --> tagging for objects in kubernetes
    - selector
      - equality-based selector --> equals
      - set-based selector --> in or not in, !app (no label key app)
  - replication controller --> ensure number of replica based on desired state of application (legacy type)
    - only support equality-based selector
  - Deployment --> manage creation, update, and deletion of pods. Automatically create replicaset.
    - Support update and rolling back (RollingUpdate strategy)
    - Deploymentcontroller is part of control plane controller manager
  - Replicaset --> control lifecycle of multiple replica of pod for HA
    - support self healing
    - support equality-based and set-based selector
    - Do not support update and rolling back
    Example in replicaset.yaml
  - service :
    - Group logical of pods that can be chosen by label and selector
    - Type of services :
        - ClusterIP
            - default service type
            - Can be accessed within cluster only
        - Nodeport
            - High port, dynamically picked port number from 30000-32767
            - Example, if we mapping port 32233 to frontend-svc, it will be directed to clusterIP of frontend-svc
            - Useful when port accessed from external user, and then proxied internally to clusterIP
        - LoadBalancer

  - kube-proxy
    - Daemon each cluster node, watching API server in control plane for addition, removal or update of service and endpoints
    - Build redundantly with iptables
    - Load balancing to endpoints/pods
    - If traffic policies not assigned, service will direct or routed traffic randomly for load balancing

  - Traffic Policies :
    - Make sure traffic routed based on policy / not randomly
    - Applied for internal traffic from cluster of external traffic from client
    - Type of traffic policies :
        - cluster
            - default behavior or traffic policies not assigned. Target all endpoints of services in load balancing
        - local
            - isolates number of pods or endpoints in service on same node in load balancing traffic
            - specific node that capture inbound traffic (Nodeport)
  - Service discovery
    - Environment variables
    - DNS
  - LoadBalancer
    - Nodeport and ClusterIP automatically
    - Service is exposed at a static port on each worker node
    - Service is exposed externally using cloud provided LoadBalancer
    - Only supported for automatic created load balancer and support kubernetes
  - ExternalIP
    - Can route one or multi worker nodes.
    - Traffic that is ingressed into cluster with externalIP as destination IP on service port, get routed to service endpoint
    - Require Load Balancer from cloud provider
    - Not managed by Kubernetes
  - ExternalName
    - No specific namespace and not define any endpoint
    - return CName record of an externally configured service
  - Multi port service
    - Expose many ports from any pod
    - Expose group of pods that contain many container with different port
  - Port Forwarding
    - Forward local port to application port
    - Application port can be pod port, service port, endpoint port, or deployment container port
    - Alternative to Nodeport, usually used for troubleshooting or debugging


Users in kubernetes authentication :
  - Normal Users
  - Service Account

Authentication modules :
  - X509 Client certificates
  - Static token file
  - Bootstrap token
  - Service account tokens
  - OpenID Connect tokens
  - Webhook Token Authentication
  - Authenticating proxy

Authorization modes : 
  - Node
    --> Used for authorization for kubelet to read operation to node, service, endpoint and write operation to node, service, endpoint, pods
  - Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)
    --> Combine Attribute with policy.
    --> For specify ABAC mode ,  --authorization-mode=ABAC and --authorization-policy-file=PolicyFile.json
  - Webhook
    --> Integrate to third party
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    - Restric based on operations or group of operations (Role), assigned to Users
    - Kind of roles
      - Role
        - Role grant to specific resources within specific namespace
      - ClusterRole
        - Same as role, but scope is cluster wide

Admission control : 
  - Specify granular Access control policies, ex : 
    - allowing priviledged container
    - checking on quota resources
    - Activated using parameter --enable-admission-plugins=NamespaceLifecycle,ResourceQuota,PodSecurity,DefaultStorageClass
  - Type of admission controllers :
    - Limitranger (Scope per individual pod or container)
      - Ensures that pods and containers have resource limits defined.
      - If LimitRange resources are defined in a namespace, LimitRanger checks whether the requests (for CPU and memory) in a pod fall within those limits.
      - If requests or limits are missing, it can set default values or deny the request if it's out of bounds.
    - ResourceQuota (Scope per namespace)
      - Enforces resource quotas in a namespace, limiting the total resource consumption for pods, services, or other Kubernetes objects within that namespace.
      - It ensures that resources (like CPU, memory, or object counts) do not exceed predefined limits.
      - If a request would exceed the quota, the admission controller denies it.
    - DefaultStorageClass
      - Ensures that persistent volume claims (PVCs) have a default storage class if none is specified.
      - When a PVC is created without specifying a storage class, the DefaultStorageClass admission controller automatically assigns the default storage class if one is available.
      - This simplifies the PVC creation process and ensures that storage is dynamically provisioned when needed.
    - AlwaysPullImages
      - Forces the imagePullPolicy of all containers to Always, regardless of what is specified in the pod specification.
      - This ensures that the latest image is always pulled from the registry, preventing accidental use of cached or old images.
      - Particularly useful in multi-tenant clusters where you want to prevent image reuse that may lead to security issues.

Liveness and Readiness Probe:
  - Liveness :
    - Used when pods still running, but application in container was issue
    - It can be caused of application deadlock or memory pressure
    - Liveness probe can help us to restart the container or application automatically based on application health
    - Can be set by:
      - Liveness command
        - Checking existence file of /tmp/healthy
      - Liveness HTTP request
        - Send HTTP GET request to /healthz of endpoint application with port 8080.
        - If failed, the kubelet will restart the container.
      - TCP Liveness probe
        - Attempts to open TCP socket to container.
        - If succeed, application considered be healthy. Otherwise, application marked as unhealthy and container will be restarted
      - gRPC Liveness probe
        - Required port to be defined
        - Optionally, use the service field to use same port with other application

  - Readiness probe
    - Ensure dependent services in ready in container before serve traffic
    - Command or template similar to liveness probe'

  - Startup probe
    - Designed for legacy application
    - Used when inizialization or startup of application take long time and used for delay the liveness and Readiness probe

Kubernetes Volume :
  - Volume
    - Storage abstraction that allow various storage technologies
    - An ephemeral volume is mount point on container file system backed by media storage
    - Ephemeral volume linked to pod
    - Volume can be shared among containers of pod
    - Type of Volume
      - emptyDir
        - tightly coupled with pod. If pod deleted or terminated, then data of emptyDir is deleted
      - hostPath
        - Shared between and host. If pod terminated, data still stored or available in host. 
      - gcePersistentDisk
      - awsElasticBlockStore
      - azureDisk
      - azureFile
      - cephfs
      - nfs
      - iscsi
      - secret
        - Supply sensitive information (password, secret, certificate, key)
      - configMap
        - Store configuration data or shell command
      - persistentVolumeClaim
        - Persistent Volume is consumed by pod using persistentVolumeClaim

  - Container Storage Interface (CSI)
    - Used for volume interface, volume plugin, designed on different container orchestrator with a variety of storage technologies

  - Persistent Volume:
    - provide APIs for manage and consume storage
    - Manage volume use PersistentVolume API resource type
    - Consume volume use persistentVolumeClaim API resource type
    - Volume types support Persistent Volume:
      - GCEPersistentDisk 
      - AWS EBS
      - Azure File 
      - Azure Disk 
      - NFS 
      - CephFS 
      - iSCSI

  - Persistent Volume Claims:
    - Request storage by user
    - Request based on access mode, storage class, size, and volume mode
    - Access mode:
      - ReadWriteOnce (read-write by single node)
      - ReadOnlyMany (read only by many nodes)
      - ReadWriteMany (read-write by many nodes)
      - ReadWriteOncePod (read-write by single pod)
    - Mounted into pods directory

ConfigMaps:
  - Decouple configuration details from container images
  - Pass key-value pairs, then used by pods
  - Usually used for Environment variables, set arguments and command
  - Guide from create or use configmaps:
    - Create configmaps from file
      - kubectl create configmap permission-config \--from-file=<path/to/>permission-reset.properties
    - Use configmaps as Environment variables:
      containers:
        - name: myapp-full-container
          image: myapp
          envFrom:
          - configMapRef:
            name: full-config-map
      #or used multiple environment variables
      -containers:
        - name: myapp-specific-container
          image: myapp
          env:
          - name: SPECIFIC_ENV_VAR1
            valueFrom:
              configMapKeyRef:
                name: config-map-1
                key: SPECIFIC_DATA
          - name: SPECIFIC_ENV_VAR2
            valueFrom:
              configMapKeyRef:
                name: config-map-2
                key: SPECIFIC_INFO
    - Use configmaps as volume: 
    
      -containers:
      - name: myapp-vol-container
        image: myapp
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config-volume
          mountPath: /etc/config
      volumes:
      - name: config-volume
        configMap:
          name: vol-config-map

Secrets:
  - Encode plain text to in base 64 the sensitive information
  - We can share sensitive information like password, tokens, or key, so secrets can reducing risk of exposure.
  - In deployment or other resources, secret object is referenced.
  - Secret loaded in plain text in etcd
  - Encryption at rest can be applied in etcd, but need enable plugin from API server
  apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: my-password
    type: Opaque {other can be kubernetes.io/service-account-token, kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson, kubernetes.io/dockercfg, kubernetes.io/tls}
    stringData:
      password: mysqlpassword
  Use secret as environment variable
  spec:
  containers:
  - image: wordpress:4.7.3-apache
    name: wordpress
    env:
    - name: WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: my-password
          key: password
  
  Use secret in pod (as volume)
  spec:
  containers:
  - image: wordpress:4.7.3-apache
    name: wordpress
    volumeMounts:
    - name: secret-volume
      mountPath: "/etc/secret-data"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: secret-volume
    secret:
      secretName: my-password

Ingress:
 - Usually, routing tables depend on service. As long as service exist, the route table exist
 - Ingress can be used, when we want decouple routing tables from application and also centralize rule management
 - Ingress is used for manage inbound connection to cluster
 - Ingress configure layer 7 HTTP/S load balancing for services and provide:
    - TLS
    - Name-based virtual hosting
    - Fanout routing
    - Load balancing
    - Custom rules
 Example in ingress.yaml
 - Ingress can be applied based on name-based virtual hosting (subdomain based routing) or fanout ingress rules (path based)
 Topology example in picture ingress-topology.png

Ingress Controller:
  - An application watching the control plane node APIserver for change of ingress resources and update L7 load balancer.
  - Also known as controllers, ingress proxy, service proxy, reverse proxy.
  - GCE L7 LB Controller, AWS LB Controller, and Nginx Ingress controller commonly used Ingress Controller.

Annotation:
  - Arbitrary non-identifying metadata to any objects in kubernetes
