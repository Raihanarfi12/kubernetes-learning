Strategy for application deployment:
- Blue/green deployment
    Deploys both the old and new versions of an application side by side. The new version is available through a different service or port, and is tested before replacing the old version.
    Also built in different environment and deployment controller, but only one environment keep receiving taffic.
- Rolling deployment
    Replaces existing pods in a cluster with a new version, one by one, without causing cluster downtime. 
- A/B testing
    Targets a specific group of customers to test how well a version achieves business goals. 
- Recreate deployment
    Shuts down the current version of an application and deploys a new version, usually causing some downtime. 
- Shadow deployment
    Allows developers to test new versions of an application without disrupting production traffic. 
- Ramped slow rollout
    Gradually increases the number of new pods to validate stability and performance.
- Canary deployment
    Runs two application releases simultaneously managed by two independent deployment controllers, both exposed by same services.
    The users can manage amount of traffic each deployment is seperated scaling up/down of two deployment controller
